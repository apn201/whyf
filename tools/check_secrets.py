"""Scan every commit for secrets and for anything from private/.

check_publishable.py looks at the working tree. That is not enough before a
repo goes public, because git history is permanent: a key committed today and
deleted tomorrow is still in the history when the repo flips to public, and
so is every file that was ever tracked.

This scans all commits, all files, all the way back.

    python tools/check_secrets.py
    python tools/check_secrets.py --verbose

Exit 1 means do not push, or do not make it public, depending on what it
found. Read what it says: some findings mean rewrite history, some just mean
rotate a credential.
