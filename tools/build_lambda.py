"""Package the Lambda without Docker.

CDK's PythonFunction bundles dependencies inside a Docker container. Docker is
not installed on this machine and installing it to build one Lambda is a poor
trade, so this does the same job with pip's cross-platform download flags.

    python tools/build_lambda.py
    python tools/build_lambda.py --check    # report size, build nothing

boto3 is deliberately not installed: the Lambda runtime already has it, and
shipping a second copy adds about 15 MB for nothing.

    This is two steps because pip will not do it in one. `--platform` picks
    which wheels are compatible, but environment markers are still evaluated
    against the interpreter that is running: on this machine that is Windows
    on Python 3.14, so `mcp` asks for pywin32, pywin32 has no Linux wheel, and
    the whole resolution fails.

    Left to recover on its own, pip backtracked to strands-agents 1.1.0, which
    has no such dependency and a different Agent() signature. It installed
    cleanly and the deployed classifier raised TypeError on every request. The
    pipeline caught it, degraded to the lexical matcher exactly as designed,
    and the agent went on answering - worse, quietly, with no error anywhere.

    So: resolve with local markers to get a version for every package, drop the
    Windows-only ones, and install each pinned with --no-deps against the Linux
    platform. The graph is solved once, by pip, and then simply fetched.
